Thanks Luke.

1. Current behaviour is to discover all nodes
python3 use-seed-demo.py "mongodb://localhost:27018/?readPreference=primaryPreferred&replicaSet=replset"

2. Note that the interface changes from the "public" (localhost)
interface provided in the connection string seed list, to whatever the mongod reports.

3. So if I do something like change the "sudo vi /etc/hosts" file simulating an
unresolvable server address for any of the reasons, like MongoDB Atlas VPC peering, that Luke discussed (and repeat):
python3 use-seed-demo.py "mongodb://localhost:27018/?readPreference=primaryPreferred&replicaSet=replset"

4. It fails to connect at all ;-(

5. But we know we can connect :D
So let's add a useSeedList=true to disable the discovery process:
python3 use-seed-demo.py "mongodb://localhost:27018/?readPreference=primaryPreferred&replicaSet=replset&useSeedList=true"

6. This disables the discovery process by limiting results to those in the seed list,
and pretends the server response is the client response, allowing connections to succeed.
It also works for multiple replica sets members:

python3 use-seed-demo.py "mongodb://localhost:27018,localhost:27019/?readPreference=primaryPreferred&replicaSet=replset&useSeedList=true"

And I'll now hand over to Anna to discuss using tags to enable high availability server discovery.
